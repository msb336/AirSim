/*
   quaternion.hpp : Support for treating quaternion as a sensor
   
   Supports IMUs like EM7180 SENtral Sensor Fusion solution, where 
   quaternion is computed in hardware, and simulation platforms like
   UE4, where quaternion is provided by physics engine. For other IMUs 
   and simulators, you can use quaternion-filter classes in filters.hpp.
